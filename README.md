Just disable everything in this tab.

### You also should set your tampermonkey settings to the following:

## How to use the extension:
This should be pretty straight forward, except for resolutions - 0 is the highest and 4 is the lowest (sometimes 3 might be the lowest and etc.)
Check resolutions you want to download, and click the button. This will force download 1000+ files if you selected resolution of 0, so be patient and don't do anything stupid.
I recomend you stay on the page while the files are downloading, that way it goes faster. You might have to play with the downloadDelay variable to get the best download speed at which zero tiles are missed in the process.
